Hi there!
Based on your bounce rate analysis, 
we ran a new custom landing page (/lander-1)
in a 50/50 test against the homepage (/home) 
for our gsearch nonbrand traffic.

Can you pull bounce rates for the two groups so we can
evaluate the new page? 
Make sure to just look at the time period where /lander-1 was getting traffic,
so that it is a fair comparison.
Thanks,Morgan.

After the result data:
Hey!
This is so great.It looks like the custom lander has a lower bounce rate...success!
I will work with Tom to get campaigns updated so that all nonbrand paid traffic is pointing to the new page.
In a few weeks, I would like you to take a look at trends to make sure things have moved in the right direction.
Thanks, Morgan

NEXT STEPS:
.	Help Morgan confirm that traffic is all running to the new custom lander after campaign updates
.	Keep an eye on bounce rates and help the team look for other areas to test and optimize
